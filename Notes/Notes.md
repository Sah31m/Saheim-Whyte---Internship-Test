**PRE COMPLETION**
After reading the README i understand there are several goals my client wants me to accomplish.

 - [ ] Interact with the user through buttons
 - [ ] Modify data with a given data set
 - [ ] Absorb and display data with a given data set
 - [ ] Replicate a given design
 - [ ] Be meticulous in terms of design
 - [ ] Test design on various devices
 - [ ] Test system behaviour
 - [ ] Readable and extendable code
 - [ ] Utilize Git
 - [ ] Extend dataset ( Missing footer text )
 
The client would also like me to use React, giving me the opportunities to use libraries like Tailwind to better design my application.

From the design image I can see that it's based on a mobile meaning that there are already design principles needed to be implemented in order for me to not copy the design but for me to enable a similar design that is native to a wider screen and still has the same level aesthetics.

I also acknowledge the use of certain components such as possibly an order component and I could reuse a field component for specification,design and then the footer.

**Post Completion**
 - [x] Interact with the user through buttons ( Increment and Decrement Buttons)
 - [x] Modify data with a given data set
 - [x] Absorb and display data with a given data set(Absorbed db.jsx datafile)
 - [x] Replicate a given design(Replicated design using colour theme)
 - [x] Be meticulous in terms of design(Copy colour theme and border radius and padding where possible)
 - [x] Test design on various devices(Viewed on mobile & modified window size)
 - [ ] Test system behaviour ( Did not do extension by testing app behaviour)
 - [x] Readable and extendable code(Made code extendable by adding use states for values)
 - [x] Utilize Git (Worked and Published on GitHub)

After completing the assignment I feel like I improved in using useState to create malleable information that can be manipulated and then displayed.

I feel like there are several areas that my app could improve, one being padding where the is about a 2% padding on the left and right. Another area I could improve on is the "Qty" text above the actual quantity which I found was tedious as well as the Decrement button turning a different colour when you can no longer decrease the value.

In summary I feel as I the client needs of course there are areas that can be modified and improved in a iterative development cycle however all of the clients needs were demonstrated.
